### Abstract
This tutorial aims to sketch the shape of an interdisciplinary approach involving artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive psychology for fake news prevention on social media platforms. One objective is to illustrate how representations of human behavior can lead to realistic models/algorithms which address different aspects of the fake news problem, e.g., characterization, detection, and mitigation of fake news. Another is to emphasize the importance of understanding/characterizing the interactions between humans and these AI-aided systems.

The tutorial consists of three parts. In the two parts, we will present summaries of the latest work in the AI and cognitive psychology communities for fake news prevention, respectively. In the third part, we will propose an approach of integrating AI & cognitive psychology to alleviate the limitations of prior research. We will point out tangible research questions that would arise from this integration, and propose possible solutions.

This tutorial is geared toward graduate students, AI researchers, and practitioners, who are interested in fake news detection and prevention but do not have much background in human factors, and want to learn about principles of human information processing and apply those principles for AI algorithms to detect and prevent fake news.
